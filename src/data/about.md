# Intro

I am a student at [NYU](https://nyu.edu) where I double major in CS and Business, and play table tennis recreationally (not well). I am particularly interested in projects that touch Large Language Models, Finance, or Education. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At New York University, I am currently optimizing for fun, and for projects that make me feel like getting out of bed early in the morning. I am currently working on a few projects, including: a GPT Model to automatically grade exams, a no-code bash command line interface, and a few other things.

# Travel / Geography

- I am from originally from Cupertino, California. I have since lived in Manhattan in the Lower East Side, as I work towards my Bachelor's Degree, but spent a summer (2022) in Washington D.C. as well.
- I've been to ~ 20 countries, some of which I have forgotten, and many of which I would like to revisit.
- In 2020, I graduated and moved to New York. Can't say I did much international traveling.
- In 2021, I lived in Spain for 3 months, and visited Italy, France, Morocco, and the U.K.
- In 2022, I travelled to Luxembourg, Mexico, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and Amsterdam.

# Fun facts

- I have a list of thousands of ideas, like creating matching bow ties for cats and humans.
- I can't locate every country on a map.
- I break about 30 traffic laws on a  [bicycle](https://www.citibikenyc.com/) every single day.
- I added this page because so many people complained that my site was just my resume.

# I dream of

- founding a company that changes human behavior.
- always finding inspiration.
- enabling a brighter future.
- doing better.
